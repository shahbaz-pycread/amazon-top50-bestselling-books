# amazon-top50-bestselling-books

In this project, I’m using the dataset that was provided by (Onyx Data)[https://onyxdata.co.uk/] for January 2021, DataDNA dataset challenges. If you want to download 
this dataset( they’ve others too), you can get it from (here)[https://onyxdata.co.uk/data-dna-dataset-challenge/datadna-dataset-archive/].

The steps that I’m following for this project:

- Import the data
- Explore the data

By looking into the data, I was able to answer the following questions:
  1) How many records are there in the table?
  
  2) How many books were written per genre by year?
  
  3) The books that were the most bestselling books between 2009 and 2019?
  
  4)Number of books written by the author between 2009 and 2019?
  
  5) Top 5 books with most numbers of reviews.
